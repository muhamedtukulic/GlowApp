GlowApp is a Kotlin-based mobile application designed to provide users with personalized skincare recommendations based on their unique skin types. 
The app features an interactive quiz that helps determine the user's skin type and provides tailored product suggestions and skincare routines.

The app offers a fun and engaging quiz that asks users a series of questions about their skin's needs and concerns.
Users earn points based on their responses, which are then used to determine their skin type at the end of the quiz.

After completing the quiz, users receive a detailed analysis of their skin type (e.g., oily, dry, combination, sensitive, etc.).
The app uses this data to recommend skincare products suited to their skin type and concerns.

GlowApp features a clean, intuitive design that makes navigating through the quiz and product recommendations a seamless experience.
The app is built with Kotlin for smooth performance and easy maintenance, ensuring a reliable experience across Android devices.
